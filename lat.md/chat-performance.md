# Chat message-list rendering performance

Typing must stay fast no matter how long the conversation is. Layout cost is bounded by CSS containment plus one batched textarea measurement; React-tree cost by transcript windowing and coalesced streaming commits (issue #748).

The symptom this guards against: in conversations with many messages, each keystroke took up to ~2.6s with an empty JS profile — the cost was entirely in Chromium's layout engine, recalculating the whole transcript on every keystroke. CPU and memory were normal; new sessions were instant. CSS containment fixed the layout half; the React half (reconciling every row on every streaming delta) is fixed by the windowing and delta coalescing described below.

## Transcript windowing

Long transcripts start with the newest [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/MessageList.tsx#TRANSCRIPT_WINDOW]] rows (100). Earlier rows collapse behind a "Show N earlier messages" button, bounding mounted rows while following output.

The window cut is computed per render in [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/MessageList.tsx]] with the following constraints:

- **Never slice out the newest bubble.** The newest visible bubble owns the last-row marker (active avatar, approval bar), so the cut clamps to its index even when a longer-than-window run of reasoning/tool rows trails it.
- **Don't split a tool run — within a bound.** The cut nudges back to the start of a contiguous tool_call/tool_result run so a ToolActivityGroup isn't cut in half, but the walk is bounded to one window: a pathological run of hundreds of tool rows splits at the bound instead of re-mounting the whole transcript (which would silently defeat the cap for exactly the agentic sessions #748 targets).
- **Don't fake a turn at the cut.** Avatar grouping consults the hidden row just above the cut (`beforeWindow`), so a mid-turn cut doesn't render a spurious avatar.

Expansion adds a budget of extra rows while following the latest output. Scrolling up pins the first mounted message by ID, preserving the text being read as new rows arrive; returning to the bottom resumes the sliding window. Each button click derives its budget from the effective cut so a tool-run adjustment cannot prevent progress.

### Reading history during streaming

New streamed rows cannot unmount the older message being read. The history boundary stays pinned until the reader returns to the bottom, where the normal window budget applies again.

A pinned boundary is not repeatedly nudged backward through a long tool run.

### Pending interaction visibility

Unresolved approval and clarification cards remain mounted even when later output exceeds the normal window. Resolving a card releases that exception so old controls can collapse with history.

### Scroll-driven auto-expansion

Scrolling near the top marker auto-reveals the next window (IntersectionObserver, 300px top rootMargin); the button stays as a fallback. A pre-paint `scrollTop` adjustment keeps the content being read in place when rows are prepended.

Two timing rules keep this correct:

- The observer is recreated after every expansion (`extraRows` is an effect dependency). IntersectionObserver only reports *transitions*, so after revealing content shorter than the rootMargin (e.g. a tool run folding into one collapsed group) a persistent observer would go silent; re-observing delivers a fresh initial entry.
- History loads scroll to the bottom **instantly**, not smoothly ([[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useChatScroll.ts#useChatScroll]]). A smooth multi-frame scroll from the top races the observer's first callback (the marker is still in view), and the expansion's scroll restore would abort the smooth scroll and strand the view mid-transcript.

Windowing behavior is specified by [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/MessageList.test.tsx]].

## Streaming delta coalescing

Streaming events arrive many times per second and each `setMessages` costs a window reconciliation, so the dashboard transport applies deltas to the transcript ref synchronously and commits to React once per animation frame at most.

See [[chat-commands#Streaming source-of-truth ref]] for the ownership rules that make this safe.

## Off-screen rows are skipped with content-visibility

Every transcript row (`.chat-message`) sets `content-visibility: auto` with `contain-intrinsic-size: auto 120px`, so the browser skips layout and paint for off-screen rows. That turns a forced reflow from O(all messages) into O(visible rows).

The rule lives on `.chat-message` in the renderer stylesheet (`src/renderer/src/assets/main.css`). That class is shared by user/agent bubbles, the reasoning and tool-activity rows, and the typing indicator (see [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/MessageList.tsx]] and [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/MessageRow.tsx]]), so one rule covers every heavy row.

The `auto` keyword in `contain-intrinsic-size` makes the browser remember each row's real measured height after it renders once, so the scrollbar and scroll position stay accurate; the `120px` is only the first-paint estimate for never-yet-rendered rows.

### Paint containment and the hover timestamp

`content-visibility` implies paint containment, which clips anything drawn outside the row's box — including the hover timestamp that sits below the bubble.

The timestamp (`.chat-bubble-time`) used to overflow ~15px below the bubble and would be clipped. It now sits at `bottom: 1px` inside the row's `padding-bottom: 16px`, so it stays visible while still appearing just under the bubble.

### Fullscreen overlays inside rows must portal to body

Paint containment also makes each row a containing block for `position: fixed` descendants — a fullscreen overlay rendered inline inside a row gets trapped and clipped to the row's box instead of covering the viewport.

The image zoom lightboxes in [[src/renderer/src/components/MediaImage.tsx]] and [[src/renderer/src/components/AttachmentChip.tsx]] hit exactly this: `.chat-image-preview-backdrop` is `position: fixed; inset: 0`, and rendered inline it appeared as a clipped strip inside the message row. Both now render through `createPortal(…, document.body)`. Any future overlay spawned from within a transcript row must do the same.

Both lightboxes share [[src/renderer/src/hooks/useLightboxClose.ts#useLightboxClose]] for Escape handling. It listens in the capture phase and stops propagation because the lightbox is the topmost modal: other overlays (e.g. the FileViewer panel) bind document-level bubble-phase Escape listeners, and without the capture+stop one keypress would close both the lightbox and the panel behind it.

## Block flow, not a flex column

The scroll container `.chat-messages` is block flow, not a flex column. A flex column measures each child to lay itself out, which defeats `content-visibility` and reports a wrong `scrollHeight`.

A correct `scrollHeight` matters because [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useChatScroll.ts#useChatScroll]] uses `scrollHeight - scrollTop - clientHeight` to decide whether the view is pinned to the bottom; a wrong value would break auto-scroll.

The flex `gap` that previously spaced rows is replaced by per-row spacing: `.chat-message` carries `padding-bottom: 16px` (which also provides the timestamp's room), and non-message children that lack it (`.chat-clarify`) carry an equivalent `margin-bottom`. Block flow also moves alignment from `align-self` to `margin-left: auto` for user rows, and the empty state fills height with `min-height: 100%` instead of `flex: 1`.

## Centered column caps line width

On wide monitors the transcript and composer live in a centered 1100px column so message lines stay readable.

The wrapper is `.chat-content-column` (`.chat-messages > .chat-content-column`, and one wrapping the input area's children), a plain block element with `max-width: 1100px` and `margin-inline: auto`; narrow windows are unaffected because the column simply fills the space. It stays block flow (no flex) so the `content-visibility` and `scrollHeight` contract above is preserved, and the worktree panel is a flex sibling of `.chat-messages`, outside the column.

## Textarea auto-resize avoids per-keystroke reflow

The composer textarea auto-grows to its content. Reading `scrollHeight` to size it forces a layout flush, so it runs once per committed value in a `useLayoutEffect` keyed on the input string, not on every keystroke.

In [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/ChatInput.tsx]] every path that changes the value (typing, history recall, voice transcription, and the imperative `setText`/`appendText`) goes through `setInput`, so the layout effect is the single owner of resizing — the other paths only set the caret and focus. Combined with the row-level `content-visibility`, the one measurement per keystroke stays O(visible rows).

The textarea opts out of the app-wide inset focus shadow and brightness filter because `.chat-input-wrapper:focus-within` already provides the composer's visible focus treatment. This avoids a redundant rectangular outline while preserving keyboard focus visibility.

## Slash command palette uses fixed-row virtualization

Large Agent command catalogs must not make opening, filtering, scrolling, or keyboard navigation proportional to the number of mounted command elements.

[[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/slash/virtualSlashCommands.ts#createSlashCommandVirtualLayout]] converts the filtered catalog into fixed-height category and command rows. The scroll viewport mounts only intersecting rows plus four command-row heights of overscan, found from the ordered layout with a binary search.

The fixed heights are an invariant shared with the `.slash-menu-item` and `.slash-menu-group-label` styles. Changing either visual height requires updating the corresponding layout constant so calculated scroll positions and the virtual canvas remain accurate.

Arrow-key selection does not query or measure command DOM nodes. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/ChatInput.tsx]] computes the selected row's offset and adjusts the list scroll position only when that row leaves the viewport, including wraparound from the first command to the last.

The searchable name and description are normalized once when the command catalog changes rather than once per command on every keystroke. The virtual canvas uses layout and paint containment, and the modal overlay avoids backdrop blur so opening the palette does not trigger a full-window blur pass.

## Table-heavy transcript heap profile

Renderer memory changes require real Chromium heap evidence before a retention fix is attempted; long transcripts legitimately retain their mounted DOM.

Issue #883 was profiled with production `MessageRow`/`AgentMarkdown` rendering and heap snapshots at baseline, 5 table-heavy turns, 50 turns, and after unmount. Used heap rose from 2.50 MB to 6.68 MB while 17,169 transcript nodes were live, then fell to 4.05 MB and 19 nodes after unmount. Detached-node count stayed flat at five after content was mounted and after unmount, so the run did not reproduce a detached DOM leak; the growth was live transcript DOM.

The profile did expose a redundant network request rather than retained objects. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useDashboardChatTransport.ts#useDashboardChatTransport]] now reuses the first `model.options` response when no slash command changed model state, while retaining the second read after `slash.exec` because commands can mutate the active model. [[src/renderer/src/screens/Chat/hooks/useDashboardChatTransport.test.tsx]] protects the one-read path.
