This directory defines the high-level concepts, business logic, and architecture of this project using markdown. It is managed by [lat.md](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lat.md) — a tool that anchors source code to these definitions. Install the `lat` command with `npm i -g lat.md` and run `lat --help`.

> **Hermes One** is a community-maintained project. This desktop app is a wrapper around **Hermes Agent** — it is **not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Nous Research**. "Hermes One" is the name of this community project; "Hermes"/"Hermes Agent" refer to the upstream agent it builds on.

- [[chat-commands]] — how typed slash commands are routed through the gateway's `slash.exec`/`command.dispatch` pipeline instead of being sent as prompt text.
- [[chat-media]] — how MEDIA tokens, platform delivery markers (`[[audio_as_voice]]`), incoming photos/voice notes, and audio files render as inline media instead of raw text.
- [[chat-envelopes]] — how machine-authored bracketed envelopes (async delegation, out-of-band steers, system notes) render as notices instead of raw bubbles.
- [[chat-input]] — the unified chat composer surface and its theme-aware animated border treatment.
- [[chat-performance]] — how chat rendering stays responsive through contained transcript rows, batched textarea resizing, and fixed-row slash-command virtualization.
- [[chat-experience-preferences]] — user-message Markdown plus persisted completion-sound and native multi-language spell-check preferences.
- [[model-context]] — the per-model context-window override that drives the context gauge and the agent's auto-compaction.
- [[model-selection]] — the session-scoped in-chat model override that switches the model (and provider) for one conversation without touching the global default.
- [[reasoning-effort]] — the composer's Faster⟷Smarter effort control: a draggable `role="slider"` over six ordered levels that stays open until dismissed and commits one `onChange` per real change.
- [[web-preview]] — the in-app split-screen webview and the `partition`-based gate that lets only it load remote HTTPS while staying sandboxed.
- [[code-blocks]] — collapsible long code blocks, and why expansion state is keyed on source position to survive react-markdown's streaming remounts.
- [[loading-indicators]] — the thinking-orbs dotted-orb loaders behind every loading state, and the OrbLoader wrapper that pins dark/light from the Hermes theme registry instead of the library's auto-detection.
- [[window-chrome]] — the browser-style title bar where open-conversation tabs sit on top of the window drag region, clickable while empty space still drags.
- [[desktop-updates]] — GitHub release checks, startup upgrade button behavior, and the Settings auto-upgrade preference.
- [[desktop-security]] — verified Unix bootstrap execution and safe rendering of runtime provider names.
- [[agent-capabilities]] — capability-based compatibility between the independent desktop and system-installed Hermes Agent, including bounded runtime evidence and update gating.
- [[connections]] — the versioned main-process connection registry, stable active connection identity, and lossless migration from the legacy singleton configuration.
- [[sidebar-navigation]] — the recent-sessions list under the Chat nav item, capped at five with a "Show more" button that opens the full session list in a modal.
- [[context-folder]] — the per-session linked working folder, persisted in a desktop-owned state.db table so a re-opened conversation restores its folder.
- [[main-process]] — the Electron main-process entrypoint, app lifecycle modules, and centralized IPC registry.
- [[remote-dashboard-oauth]] — direct Remote dashboard browser authentication, main-process cookie isolation, and single-use WebSocket ticket handling.
- [[onboarding]] — the shared cinematic first-run chrome (OnboardHero): aurora backdrop, animated Hermes emblem with the big-centre → fly-up intro, and the Welcome / Install redesign built on it.
- [[provider-setup]] — the first-run provider picker; its top grid mirrors the agent's native `CANONICAL_PROVIDERS` while OpenAI-compatible endpoints route through the Local presets.
- [[hermes-account-login]] — desktop sign-in to a Hermes account via the RFC 8628 device grant; secure token storage, IPC, and the Providers-screen entry point.
- [[agent-sync]] — bidirectional sync of desktop profiles with the signed-in account's cloud agents (persona, memory, color, model/provider) via the backend's `/api/agents`; hash-based per-part conflict handling, no deletion propagation.
- [[kanban]] — the JIRA-style multi-agent board tab; a thin client over the `hermes kanban` CLI with canonical status columns, an archived toggle, and focus/poll refresh.
- [[analytics]] — privacy-first, opt-out usage analytics that POST anonymous events to the in-house Hermes analytics service, keyed by a per-install localStorage UUID; replaces the former PostHog integration.
- [[wallet-token-balances]] — profile-scoped Base mainnet wallets with encrypted recovery phrases, and on-chain ERC-20 token balance reads via ethers v6.
- [[gateway-restart-gate]] — defers config-change gateway restarts while agent work is in flight, and classifies never-ended subagent rows killed by an old restart as died.
- [[office-3d-traffic]] — the Office tab's backdrop traffic: car-following and junction-yielding simulation, per-model nose orientation, and instanced fleet rendering in a dozen draw calls.
- [[office-3d-interiors]] — enterable office/bank/showroom interiors: per-location conditional mounting (city unmounts while indoors), camera fly-in rig, interactable objects (ATM → wallet, desk → agent, car → spec card), and idle-agent walking trips between buildings.
- [[office-3d-walk-mode]] — GTA-style walk mode: glass roofs over the enterable buildings, the user's own third-person avatar (WASD + chase camera, shared crowd/collision), doorway-driven interior loading, and proximity Press-E interactions.
- [[office-interactions]] — space representatives: interactive bank tellers whose menu runs account status, balances, and account creation against the hermes-one backend for a chosen agent; the extensible pattern for future spaces (showroom sales, building space).
- [[office-world-actions]] — chat-commanded errands: the agent's LLM emits world-action blocks from the office chat, its avatar walks the trip route to the bank/showroom, and the rep modal auto-opens running the requested action on arrival.
- [[mcp-servers]] — add / edit / remove / enable / test MCP servers from the Capabilities → MCP tab; the shared add+edit modal and the in-place atomic `updateMcpServer` upsert (config.yaml locally, gateway REST in Remote/SSH).
- [[scheduled-jobs]] — schedule state normalization across local files, remote API responses, and named SSH profiles.
- [[discover-marketplace]] — the Discover tab: community-registry catalog (public GitHub) with per-kind installs; in direct Remote mode every installed marker and "Set up" action targets the SERVER through the dashboard REST API.

- [[dashboard-clarify]] — Interactive WebSocket clarification cards and answer delivery tests.
- [[dashboard-detach]] — what happens to an in-flight chat turn when its dashboard event stream is torn down (connection switch, socket drop): clean retirement, revision gating, and resync on reactivation.
